xrolodex is a Rolodex(R)-style cardfile application.  xrolodex's\n\
top-level window includes four principal components:\n\
\n\
 - an application-level menubar\n\
 - a label area for displaying the name of the current rolodex file\n\
 - a control panel for entry-level rolodex manipulation\n\
 - an edit window (with local menubar or pop-up menu) for editing the\n\
   current rolodex entry, also providing a basic viewport facility\n\

		{"Start-up File",
"Start-up File:\n\
\n\
xrolodex has one command-line option for naming the icon:\n\
\n\
{your prompt} xrolodex [<filename>] [-iconName <icon name>]\n\
\n\
(Note the mixed upper- and lowercase characters in `-iconName'.)\n\
\n\
A start-up filename is optional.  That is, you can specify a file\n\
from the file selection box that is activated by the \"New...\" or\n\
\"Open...\" entries in the \"File\" menu.\n\
\n\
\"New...\" and \"Open...\" are the same.  To create a _new_ rolodex\n\
file, first use \"New...\" (or \"Open...\") to associate the rolodex\n\
contents with a nonexistent filename, and then simply type in each\n\
entry--you must provide a filename before entering rolodex entries.\n\
\n\
"
		},
		/* HELP TOPIC */
		{"File Operations",
"File Operations:\n\
\n\
During normal operations, xrolodex maintains a rolodex file in\n\
memory.  That is, when you \"Open...\" a file, its contents are read\n\
into RAM, and all rolodex operations are applied to this \"memory\n\
file.\"  When you select \"Save\" from the \"File\" menu, the rolodex\n\
file as it exists in memory is saved to disk, replacing the\n\
original rolodex file.  The first time that a file is saved after\n\
it has been loaded with \"Open...\" a back-up of the original file\n\
is created with \".bak\" appended to the filename.  For subsequent\n\
save operations (without an intervening use of \"Open...\"), the\n\
back-up file remains unchanged.\n\
\n\
The \"Save As...\" menu option saves the current rolodex file under\n\
an alternate name.\n\
\n\
Use \"New...\" to open a new, empty rolodex file.\n\
\n\
The \"Print...\" menu option activates the Print dialog box (see the\n\
help topic \"Printing\").\n\
\n\
The \"Exit\" menu option terminates the application.  If there are\n\
unsaved changes to the rolodex file, you are prompted and given an\n\
opportunity to save changes to disk before the program terminates.\n\
\n\
"
		},
		/* HELP TOPIC */
		{"File Format",
"File Format:\n\
\n\
With xrolodex the rolodex file is completely free-form.  There are\n\
no limitations on the number of entries, and no limitations on the\n\
character dimensions of an individual entry.  Individual entries\n\
are separated in the rolodex file by preceding each entry with a\n\
special character sequence, which is transparent to users.  We\n\
sometimes refer to this separator string as the delimiter sequence.\n\
Users who like to edit rolodex files from a text editor typically\n\
include a newline character in the delimiter sequence, so that the\n\
delimiter appears on a separate line in the rolodex file.\n\
\n\
Because xrolodex's rolodex file is a simple stream of bytes,\n\
experienced UNIX users can use other text processing tools to\n\
manipulate the rolodex file(s).  In particular, you can use your\n\
own/preferred text editor, if you need to perform a considerable\n\
amount of editing on a particular file.  With xrolodex you can\n\
maintain as many distinct rolodex files as you need.  The \"Open...\"\n\
menu option allows you to load any rolodex file via a file selection\n\
box.  The default file type/specification is \"*.xrolo\" in the user's\n\
home directory.  You might want to add a subdirectory specification\n\
so that all your rolodex files exist in a separate directory within\n\
your home directory.  (See the example in the class file for\n\
xrolodex, namely, XRolodex.)\n\
\n\
"
		},
		/* HELP TOPIC */
		{"Rolodex Entries",
"Rolodex Entries:\n\
\n\
When viewing an individual rolodex entry you can change it simply\n\
by moving the mouse pointer into the rolodex entry viewport and\n\
using normal Motif editing commands--the viewport is implemented\n\
with a standard Motif text widget.  If the number of lines exceeds\n\
the height of the window, you can scroll the edit window.\n\
\n\
\"Insert\" clears the edit window and allows you to enter a new\n\
rolodex entry before (prior to) the current entry.  xrolodex\n\
_automatically_ saves the contents of the current rolodex entry (if\n\
modifications have been made) any time you perform an operation that\n\
switches to another rolodex entry, e.g., \"Next\", \"Index\", etc.\n\
\n\
You can select \"Copy\" to enter a duplicate of any entry into the\n\
rolodex file.  This provide a convenient mechanism for creating a new\n\
entry by copying an existing rolodex entry, and then making changes\n\
to the new entry.  As an alternative, you could use \"Copy\" (from the\n\
viewport \"Edit\" menu) to copy an entry's text to the clipboard,\n\
select \"Insert\" to create an empty entry, and then \"Paste\" the\n\
text from the clipboard--pressing \"Copy\", however, is considerably\n\
faster.\n\
\n\
\"Delete\" deletes the current rolodex entry.  xrolodex provides a\n\
single level of undo capability for \"Delete\"ions with the \"Undelete\"\n\
button.  \"Undelete\" recovers the deleted entry at the current\n\
position in the rolodex file, not at its original location.\n\
\n\
\"Insert After\" is similar to \"Insert\", except that it inserts the\n\
entry _after_ the current entry.\n\
\n\
Note that with \"Insert After\" you can add an entry to the very end\n\
of the rolodex file.\n\
\n\
"
		},
		/* HELP TOPIC */
		{"Control Panel",
"Control Panel:\n\
\n\
For convenience, several of the menu buttons are present in the\n\
control panel as well.  The control panel is to the left of the\n\
viewport and is used for moving _among_ rolodex entries.  It contains\n\
buttons for the most commonly used operations so that the user does\n\
not have to go to a pull-down menu.  The \"First\", \"Last\", \"Next\",\n\
and \"Previous\" buttons are self-explanatory.  Several other command\n\
buttons require explanation.\n\
\n\
\"Insert\" clears the edit window and allows you to enter a new rolodex\n\
entry.  xrolodex _automatically_ saves the contents of the current\n\
rolodex entry in the file (if modifications have been made) any time\n\
that you perform an operation that switches to another rolodex entry\n\
, e.g., \"Next\", \"Index\", etc.\n\
\n\
You can select \"Copy\" to enter a duplicate of any entry into the\n\
rolodex file.  This provide a convenient mechanism for creating a new\n\
entry by copying an existing rolodex entry, and then making changes\n\
to the new entry.  As an alternative, you could use \"Copy\" (from the\n\
viewport \"Edit\" menu) to copy an entry's text to the clipboard,\n\
select \"Insert\" to create an empty entry, and then \"Paste\" the\n\
text from the clipboard--pressing \"Copy\", however, is considerably\n\
faster.\n\
\n\
\"Index...\" activates a top-level window that, by default, displays\n\
the first line/row of every rolodex entry.  With this convention in\n\
mind, you should make sure that the beginning of the first line of\n\
each entry contains meaningful information, e.g., a person's name.\n\
If you select one of the entries displayed in the index window, that\n\
rolodex entry will be displayed in the edit window/viewport.\n\
Optionally, you can set the index row with the `indexRow' resource,\n\
or modify it dynamically from the dialog box that is accessed through\n\
the \"Set Index Row\" submenu.\n\
\n\
The buttons in the control panel are organized such that those\n\
buttons providing duplicate services, i.e., operations equivalent to\n\
a button in a pull-down menu, are at the bottom of the control panel.\n\
Thus, if you need to reduce the height of xrolodex, these\n\
nonessential buttons will be clipped (made invisible) before the\n\
essential buttons.  In this case, you can use the pull-down menus to\n\
perform these operations until you free up enough screen space to\n\
expand xrolodex such that the entire control panel is once again\n\
visible.\n\
\n\
"

		/* HELP TOPIC */
		{"Searching",
"Searching:\n\
\n\
\"Find Entry...\" activates a top-level window in which you can enter\n\
a string.  xrolodex will search forward or backward, beginning with\n\
the next (previous) rolodex entry, for the first entry that contains\n\
the specified text string, presenting that entry in the viewport.\n\
By default, text searches across entries are case insensitive.  You\n\
can enable case sensitive searching with a toggle button from the\n\
toggle box.  You can also enable wraparound searches from the last\n\
to the first and the first to the last entries.\n\
\n\
\"Index...\" activates a top-level window that, by default, displays\n\
the first line/row of every rolodex entry.  With this convention in\n\
mind, you should make sure that the beginning of the first line of\n\
each entry contains meaningful information, e.g., a person's name.\n\
If you select one of the entries displayed in the index window, that\n\
rolodex entry will be displayed in the edit window/viewport.\n\
Optionally, you can set the index row with the `indexRow' resource,\n\
or modify it dynamically from the dialog box that is accessed through\n\
the \"Set Index Row\" submenu.\n\
\n\
"
		},
		/* HELP TOPIC */
		{"Sorting",
"Sorting:\n\
\n\
The \"Sort\" menu contains three entries.  \"Ascending\" and \"Descending\"\n\
initiate the sort directly from the menu, so that you do not have to\n\
keep an active sort window.  \"Set Sort Row\" activates a dialog box\n\
where you can change the sort row (field).  The rolodex entries are\n\
sorted in memory and there is no provision for undoing the sort, so\n\
you may want to consider saving the rolodex file before sorting.\n\
\n\
Each rolodex entry is free-form--there are no formatted sort fields.\n\
You can, in effect, establish sort fields by placing sort-related\n\
information on specific rows, consistently for each rolodex entry,\n\
e.g., on the first line.  Since sorting is applied to the entire\n\
stream of characters that makes up the entry (beginning at the\n\
current sort row), line breaks have no real effect on the sorting\n\
algorithm.  In the simplest case, you can just enter a person's name\n\
on the first line, last name first, e.g.:\n\
\n\
<last name>, <first name>, <middle initial>\n\
<remainder of rolodex entry>\n\
\n\
"
		},
		/* HELP TOPIC */
		{"Printing",
"Printing:\n\
\n\
The \"Print...\" entry in the \"File\" menu activates the Print dialog\n\
box.  From this dialog you can set two print states via toggle\n\
buttons, as well as the actual print command.  You can also elect to\n\
print either the current entry or all entries.\n\
\n\
The \"Print to standard output\" toggle is off by default; this toggle\n\
sends the text to standard output instead of to the printer.  Unless\n\
you have redirected standard output to a file, enabling this option\n\
will send text to the command window from which you started xrolodex.\n\
\n\
The \"Add formfeed after each entry\" toggle is off by default,\n\
allowing multiple rolodex entries per page and allowing entries to\n\
split across pages.  If you enable this option, xrolodex will print\n\
one entry per page (and potentially printing many pages).\n\
\n\
The \"Print Current\" button prints the rolodex entry currently\n\
displayed in the rolodex viewport.  The \"Print All\" button prints all\n\
of the rolodex entries for the current rolodex file.\n\
\n\
The \"Print command:\" text field is valid only when the text is\n\
directed to the printer, not to standard output.  In this field you\n\
can specify any valid print command for your workstation; the default\n\
is \"lp\".  You can configure the default (start-up) print command with\n\
the `printCommand' resource (see the help topic \"Configuration\").\n\
\n\
Note that under CDE you can specify the \"dtlp\" print command, in lieu\n\
of manually building an \"lp\" print command in the text field with\n\
various command-line options.  If you specify \"dtlp\", it will provide\n\
a dialog box for entering the number of copies, etc.\n\
\n\
"
		},
		/* HELP TOPIC */
		{"Options",
"Options:\n\
\n\
The \"Options\" menu's first entry invokes the \"Delimiter\" menu from\n\
which you can dynamically modify the delimiter sequence for rolodex\n\
entries (see the \"Files\" help topic).  Note that most users have no\n\
reason to modify, or even be aware of, the delimiter sequence.  This\n\
facility is intended primarily for users who want to import or export\n\
rolodex files for other rolodex applications that have a fixed\n\
delimiter sequence.\n\
\n\
You can modify the current delimiter dynamically via a text-entry\n\
dialog, or you can reset the delimiter to the start-up default value,\n\
that is, to the value specified with the `entryDelimiter' resource.\n\
\n\
When specifying a delimiter in the dialog box, you can use any\n\
printable character, as well as several escape sequences for special\n\
characters:\n\
\n\
\\n -- newline,\n\
\\t -- horizontal tab,\n\
\\v -- vertical tab,\n\
\\b -- backspace,\n\
\\r -- carriage return,\n\
\\f -- formfeed,\n\
\\\\ -- backslash,\n\
\\' -- single quote,\n\
\\\" -- double quote, and\n\
\\nnn -- the three-digit ASCII octal value for any character.\n\
\n\
The following examples illustrate several possible delimiters,\n\
including multiple ways of specifying the same delimiter:\n\
\n\
Dialog Box Entry   Interpretation         Comment\n\
----------------   --------------         -------\n\
####\\n             ####<newline>          This is the default value,\n\
                                          \"####\" on a separate line\n\
\\043###\\n          ####<newline>          43 (octal) is ASCII for \"#\"\n\
####\\012           ####<newline>          12 (octal) is <newline>\n\
\\f\\n               <formfeed><newline>    Formfeed on a separate line\n\
[next-entry]\\n      [next-entry]<newline> A simple text string\n\

		{"Viewport Editor",
"Viewport Editor:\n\
\n\
xrolodex can be configured with either a local menubar or a pop-up\n\
menu system for the editor/viewport facility.  If xrolodex does not\n\
display a local menubar at the top of the viewport, you should use\n\
mouse button 3 to activate the pop-up menu system.  To request a\n\
local menubar for the viewport instead of the pop-up menu system,\n\
set the resource `viewportMenuBar' to \"True\", e.g.,\n\
\n\
xrolodex*viewportMenuBar:  True\n\
\n\
The editor facility provides menus for copy, cut, and paste\n\
operations and for search-and-replace operations.  The editor\n\
window allows the user to edit the text within the currently\n\
displayed rolodex entry, not the entire rolodex file--the scrollbar\n\
will not navigate across entries.  Entry-level rolodex operations\n\
are performed elsewhere.  Since the editor maintains its internal\n\
state from one entry to the next, you can copy and paste text\n\
across entries.\n\
\n\
Within the edit window you can copy and cut the primary selection\n\
to the clipboard, paste text from the clipboard, and clear the\n\
clipboard.  Copy, cut, paste, and clear operations apply to the Motif\n\
clipboard, not the X clipboard.  You can use the \"Find Selection\"\n\
menu option to find the next occurence (forward) of the currently\n\
selected text.  The \"Search and Replace...\" menu option activates a\n\
top-level window that you can use to enter search text manually.  It\n\
also contains a \"Replace\" button so that you can \"Find\" a text\n\
segment and then \"Replace\" it.  Coordinated operations with \"Find\"\n\
and \"Replace\" will allow you to make changes to the text throughout\n\
the current rolodex entry.\n\

The `centerDialogs' resource applies to the pop-up, warning dialogs\n\
only, not the text-entry dialogs.  You can control various aspects of\n\
the text-entry dialogs via the resource `minimalDialogs'.\n\
\n\
The default viewport menu is a pop-up, background menu; see the\n\
\"Editor\" help menu.  There are approximate lower limits on the\n\
size of the viewport window because Motif will force the viewport's\n\
row-column dimensions to be large enough to fill the top-level window,\n\
which must be large enough to accommodate the top-level menubar and\n\
the control panel.\n\
\n\
The default card delimiter sequence is \"####\" on a separate line,\n\
that is, \"####\\n\".  There is no reason for the typical xrolodex\n\
user to specify the delimiter option; it is transparent during normal\n\
xrolodex use.  Note, however, that you can dynamically modify the\n\
delimiter sequence from the \"Options\" menu.\n\
\n\
Unless otherwise specified using the `directoryMask' resource,\n\
xrolodex uses your home directory as the reference point for the\n\
file selection box.\n\
\n\
The `findSensitive' and `findWraparound' resources control the\n\
start-up states of the \"Case sensitive\" and \"Wraparound\" toggles\n\
in the \"Find Entry...\" window.\n\
\n\
The `forceSave' resource controls whether the \"Save\" option in the\n\
\"File\" menu saves the rolodex file or simply ignores the save request\n\
when there have been no modifications.\n\
\n\
The `printCommand' resource sets the default/start-up value for the\n\
